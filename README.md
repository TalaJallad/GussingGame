# Lab02_201
This project is a guessing game about myself for the website users to play.
I have added some information about my self on the website and quizzed the user on it. 
# Lab03
For this lab, I have enhanced my CSS design and added more questions.

* Question 6 asks the user to guess a number. I built using a for loop with if statemts. 
* Question 7 asks the user to guess a name with more than one correct answer available. I created t using the Array variable and a foor loop with if and else if statements
nested in it. 
* I aslo added a variable that calculates the user's total score in the quiz.
